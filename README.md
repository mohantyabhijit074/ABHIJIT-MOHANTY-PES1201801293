Exploratory Data Analysis for Global Terrorism Trends
Introduction
According to a survey, about 218 million people are affected by calamities, natural and man-made, per annum and about 68000 people loose their lives every year. The frequency of natural disasters like earthquakes, volcanoes, etc have remained broadly constant, but the number of terrorist activities have grown over the period.

This project aims to :
Explore the terrorist attacks across the globe since the 1970s.
Analyse the terrorism trends in various regions of the world and examine the attack prone areas.
Attempt to visualise the available data in forms of various graphs and plots.
Dataset
This is a semi-structured dataset (.csv files).
It contains information about the terrorist attacks across the globe since 1970 to 2017.
It has been obtained from kaggle.
It has 181692 records (rows) and 135 columns.
It has variables like "year", "country", "region", "city", "latitude", "longitude", "attack type", "weapon type", etc.
There is a significant amount of missing data and NaNs. For example, there are 4557 missing longitude values and 4556 missing lattitude values.
It has been split into 2 csv files : "global_terrorism_1.csv" and "global_terrorism_2.csv" due to github upload limit.
